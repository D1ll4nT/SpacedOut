# SpacedOut

## Description
This payload remaps all non-alphanumeric keys on the keyboard to the space bar. It is intended for use on Windows 10 systems and uses PowerShell to execute the remapping script. Created to be used with a USBRubberDucky but should work with any device capable of executing duckyscript. 

## Notes
- Ensure PowerShell execution policy is set to allow script execution.
- This payload should be tested in a controlled environment before deployment.
- Purely destructive payloads are not acceptable; use this script responsibly.
- To restore the original keyboard mapping, run the `restore_mapping.ps1` script.
